_RTEPs_, or _RCAX Token Enhancement Proposals_, are used to suggest and discuss changes, enhancements, and standards for the RCAX token contract. RTEPs allow the RCAX community to propose improvements and provide a structured process for their consideration. They go through a formal process of discussion and review before being implemented. This system helps maintain the development and evolution of the RCAX token in a decentralized and community-driven manner.
